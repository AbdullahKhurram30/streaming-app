# Abdullah's Streaming Website

## Description

This is my first attempt at making a web application integrated with a streaming service. For this, I have made a website where users can register and login to their respective accounts. Moreover, the web application has multiple user functionality as well backed by a database. The user can create an account and then log in to the board. Passwords are hashed using the bcrypt library so that they are not stored in plain text.

## Usage

After cloning the repository, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py
```
